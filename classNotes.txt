type of css we can use in our project -> 
            normal css
            scss
            Inline css
            UI libraries (Material UI, Base UI, Ant UI, Chakre UI, styled components & Tailwind css.)

        Tailwind css: 
                    (Why) :

                    (How) :



        Pros and cons of Tailwind :

        Pros:   Easy to debug. (code is less),
                bundle is small
                faster development
                A lot more control over css.
                (html,css,js ) in the same file.

        cons:   Initial learning curve (every new developer comes to our project he will have to learn this.)
                a lot of code will be in the class in opening tags, but it is ok, becasue en the end we have to use css file otherwise.
