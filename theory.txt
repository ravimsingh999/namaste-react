Question: When and why we need lazy load?
Answer: Suppose in a large application there are 100+ components and when we bundle them by our bundler then our one bundled js file will be big and it will take time, so it is not a optimized way. So we need to bundle things seprately , we should do chunking.
                                
                How We can do ->
                We will use lazy() function for import where we want to apply lazy loading. it is in react lib , we have to use named import.
        Syntax- normal : import component_name from "/location"
                with lazy : const component_name = lazy(()=>import("/location")).

Question : What is Suspense?
Answer:  if we lazy load things it may happen that react will try to render before it loads so for that,
            we use Suspense , it is again a named import from react lib , we have to use named import.
            Syntax - <Suspense> <component_name />  </Suspense>
            Till the pages loads we can show some msg or shimmer UI : syntax - <Suspense fallback={<Shimmer /> or <h1>Some messages</h1>}> <component_name />  </Suspense>

Question: Advantages and disadvantages of using this code spliting patten.
Answer : Advantages :   in large application it will increase the peformence of our app.
                        reduce initial loading time.
                        bundled js file will be light weight.
        
        disadvantages:  If the app is very small, then it may be a disadvantage.
                        
                        // do google for more disadvantage.

Question: When do we need and why we need Suspense?
Answer: When react try to render the component before it is loaded , then a error will come, to prevent that we need Suspense.
        basically when we use Suspense then react knows okay it is a lazy load, wait for some ms(time).
        Also in Suspense we can give pre messages or shimmer UI until the actual component is load.
