Question :  What is a microservice?
Answer:     Microservices: In current time, this architecture is being used by industry. in this way, our whole project will be devided in other other Microservices and these microservices will be hosted on diffrent diffrent ports.
                like These can be microservices in the same project : UI, backend, log, authentication.
                    and also these microservices will be handled by diffrent teams, diffrent repositories.
                    and it will be deployed seprately.
                
                Advantage:  Sepration of concern  or single responsibility.
                            easy to test, maintain.
                            Easy to handle.
                            can use many technologies in same project. like UI - react , backend - java, notification - python, logs- php, authentication - golang.
                
                How it works : lets assume react will be run on :   port: 1234,
                                            backend will be run on: port: 1235, like that...

                                or
                                port 3000 ---> /
                                port 4000 ---> /dapi/
                                port 3500 ---> /notification

Question :  what is monolith architecture?
Answer:     MONOLITH : Here only one project will be there, all the UI, backend, log, authentication all the functioanlity will be in the same project. that's why it is monolithic.
            Advantage :     don't have to manage diffrent projects and repositories.
            Disadvantage:   Hard to manage, like if we have to add a button in the project then we have to deploy the whole project again.
                            Language barrier, we can not just make any functioanlity with other other frameworks and languages.
            

Question :  What is the diffrence between monolith and Microservice ?
Answer:     

Question:   Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
Answer:     its a react hook, we use this hook for making a api call or something which we want how it rerender.
                like example , if we are calling a api in a component so whenever that component will rerender our api will be called and it will load. to prevent this we will use a react hook called useEffect.

                useEffect is a function, which takes two params , one is a callback function and other is dependency array.
                we have to use named import to use this.

                ** when our page will load, it will be called once.
                ** whenever our dependency will be change it will be called.
                ** if dependency array will be empty, this will be called just once when page loads.
                            & when will it be called, if dependency array is empty, after loading the page or before, it will be called after, because it uses callback function and dependency array is empty so it will not be depended on anything so it will be called after.

                            empty dependency array ==> once after render
                            dependency array [x,y,z] ==> once after initial render + everytime after render (dependency state will be change)

Question:   what is Optional chaining?
Answer:     The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is undefined or null, it returns undefined instead of throwing an error.
            * this is a very imp thing to implement in our code because if we are not getting a data correctly or we are getting that data is null, or may be that data is getting load that's why it is null, in this scenario it it very important.

Question : What is the diffrence between JS expression and JS statement?
Answer:     JS expression : At its core, an expression is a bit of JavaScript code that produces a value.
                                For example, these are all expressions:

                                1 ‚Üí produces 1
                                "hello" ‚Üí produces "hello"
                                5 * 10 ‚Üí produces 50
                                num > 100 ‚Üí produces either true or false
                                isHappy ? "üôÇ" : "üôÅ" ‚Üí produces an emoji
                                [1, 2, 3].pop() ‚Üí produces the number 3

            JS statement : A JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. Each statement is an instruction for the computer to do something.
                            like example : let x = 5; or if else statement etc....

Question : What is Conditional rendering? explain with a code example
Answer:     if we have some jsx/component to be rendered and we put certain condition on it that if this condition will be true then this component or jsx will have to rendered and vice versa.
                example :   {isLoggedIn === false ? (
                            <button onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(true)}>logout</button>
                            ) : (
                            <button onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(false)}>login</button>
                            )}        
                        // Here isLoggedIn can be a stateVariable or js variable.
