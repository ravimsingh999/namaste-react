Question : How tp configure Tailwind?
Answer:     To configure Tailwind , we have to go to the tailwind web , and acc to our bundler we have to configure the tailwind.
            like in parcel :
                    - run command - npm i -d tailwindcss postcss
                    - run command - npx-tailwindcss init
                    - we have to make a .postcssrc file.
                    - we have to set tailwind.config.js file with module.exports = {
                                                                                        content: [
                                                                                          "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
                                                                                        ],
                                                                                        theme: {
                                                                                          extend: {},
                                                                                        },
                                                                                        plugins: [],
                                                                                    }
                    - in the main css file, like index.css -> we have to put these three lines :    @tailwind base;
                                                                                                    @tailwind components;
                                                                                                    @tailwind utilities;

Question: Why do we have .postcssrc file?
Answer:   this file is for post css to tell that we are using tailwind plugin.
            postcss is like a compiler of tailwind, it compiles tailwind css into normal css, which browser understands.
